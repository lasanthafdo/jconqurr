= Introduction =

JConqurr is a tool kit for Java that enables the developer to automatically convert their code to multi-threaded code. The first stage of the project comprises of developing a framework based on marker-annotations and directives that will convert the specified code segment suitable for parallel processing. In this stage, the tool kit would rely on the developer to place the markers correctly.
In the second stage, the tool kit would attempt to automatically identify parallel convertible code segments and insert the markers automatically.
